Im doing a lot of travel back and forth.. and now since I&rsquo;be been living with a close friend of mine in the work location, I had to socialize more.. which is not a bad thing..

I&rsquo;ve already started to workout more, the goal here is to build my old stamina and going back to gym.. yea..back.
