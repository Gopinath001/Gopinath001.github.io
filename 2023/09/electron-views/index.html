Overcoming the lack of support of z-Index on Electron Views</p><h2 id=figma-design-views>Figma design views</h2><p>Maybe this can be solved in a different way, maybe there is even an official solution, but when I searched for zindex for browser views, there was not any solution.</p><p>For the project, I needed to work with showing different views simultaneously at the same time.</p><p>All the views are maintained and accessbile in electron api&rsquo;s, In addition to that, I built a wrapper Class that track all the windows in the app, It also trackts what is the current active view.</p><h3 id=what-i-mean-by-main-view-current-active-view>What I mean by main view/ current active view?</h3><p><figure><img src=//bluepie.in/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src="//bluepie.in/images/posts/Solving an electron problem/view-expl-part-1.png" alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><ul><li>Section labelled as &ldquo;1&rdquo; is like a sidebar to a website, its main purpose of it is to switch between showing content on section labelled as &ldquo;2&rdquo;.</li><li>Both &ldquo;1&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;2&rdquo; are <a href=https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-view rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>BrowserViews</a> positioned absolutely using <a href=https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-view#viewsetboundsbounds-experimental rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>set bounds</a></li></ul><h3 id=the-problem>The problem</h3><p>If the view for the left sidebar (section &ldquo;1&rdquo; from image) has to show a popup, that is beyound the bounds (width and height), the content in the view will be cut-off by the main view (section &ldquo;2&rdquo; of the image). In browser if we were to do this, we can set <code>z-index</code> to overcome the issue, this is true even for electron, if we have used the <code>iframe</code> instead of <code>BrowserView</code>,</p><p><figure><img src=//bluepie.in/images/ring.svg data-sizes=auto data-src="//bluepie.in/images/posts/Solving an electron problem/view expl - part 3.png" alt class=lazyload><figcaption class=image-caption></figcaption></figure></p><h3 id=solution>Solution</h3><p>Since <code>BrowserViews</code> does not have <code>z-index</code>, I have to find a different solution. In <code>BrowserView</code> the last added window is always placed on top of other windows. So this is the reason, the sidebar view (section 1) has its view (view that is out of bounds) cut-off.

#popupCoordinates, popupProfile are just x,y values &amp; status, whether to show or hide the popup
</code></pre><p>like I said code is self explanatory.
I&rsquo;ve had this in draft for over couple of months now.. I wanted to check office laptop to refer my code to be accurate, finally had the urge to open office laptop..at 408am.
like I said in the begining personal udpate.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Electron is fun, using exisiting tech that we already know to speed up the dev process to deliver quick.. maybe I will cover bundling/building in a diff post..if I feel that I can contribute something different than what is already present all over the internet.</p><p>I made the bad desicision of looking back into my past.. I shouldn&rsquo;t have.. and tried to make contact.. why did I do that? (not influenced by core belief&hellip;suggestions?) by the time I got a response, I was already regretting and back to my current self of just moving forward. all happended in july (remember future me!)</p><p>The thing about memories,it has proven me once again. Since I started to write..complete and had this post in draft for months, I already forgot a lot.. if I remembered all the things from the begining paragraph while making decisions over the last months, I would have made differnet decisions. Memory is really important to _ your _ &amp; _.. (future me remebers?) maybe I can build something for me that keeps track of all these.. with a search user interface and a keyword.. so I can make an informed decision?? google tasks, keep already do this.. no?..something to think about for me. Hope future me reads this and realises how important some small things can be.</p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>
