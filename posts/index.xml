      <description>hola amigos&amp;rsquo;, how are you guys doing? im fine thank you!. Status Update: About last week, I have covered some ground interms of development in old passion projects, the start of the week was great, but at the end of the week it got worse, nevertheless im happy that i survived this week &amp;gt;_&amp;lt;. Saw avengers end game the other day which was cool, during part-I I was studying, but for part-II -an adult going to office (feels wierd even to think, So much change in just one year), Personally nothing great happened, because of the mind that i have, I had the same bs.</description>

      <description>heya!, this wont be a rant..trust me!, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I lost my cool in the last few posts, well thats aside, let me begin.
 migration so i have been planning to migrate my blog from aws to replace it with jekyll, hexo,..etc, The main reason being, i run my blog in php and thus intend to replace it with the mentioned above, The another this that I keep pondering over and over is that, if i abandon my aws blog, I have to convert my previous post from the blog to the new version, reformat, reupload the images as well.</description>

&lt;p&gt;***I know i&amp;rsquo;ve been busy, but i can make up to it. Status update First: The last few weeks,infact the last month is very odd and had a busy schedule. I could&amp;rsquo;nt concentrate on few other projects, Office work took over my life, to be exact!.I&amp;rsquo;ve been the preacher of saying Complete office work early as possible and leave office by 8pm, later spend time for yourself(doing your own thing) like for an example updating blog. To think that i used to say those things but in reality i ended up like this!..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;why this all of a sudden? I was introduced to php development for a little while now, and i had this in mind with several other things, this would also be a good point to start explaining with code, So where to start. let us define? It starts with what is the requirement? It is&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So in the recent trend of the modern world, with everyone developing new software and technology and aiming to make the life of mankind easy, There are bunch of people who want to just learn new stuff and constantly do things and move on to the next thing.. i consider myself being in that bunch.. this will matter later. The thing about old projects is that they have an emotional touch with them, the reason why i am stating this is because,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Hi again, Today I am going to share something that is somewhat related to reverse engineering. Well I was working on a project, at one point of time I was working on wireframes, since I was only doing the initial design and it would be just used as a reference by the design team so my senior adviced me to use mockup.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I wanna share something that I found was very useful in the recent times, which is ofcourse software engineering and backend design When I started developing.. at first I was a noob &amp;lsquo;as people would call&amp;rsquo; I would do random sh**&amp;hellip; I can explain this in more detail.. which is I would go straight to coding, learning the concepts that I need to implement a certain feature.. sometimes I would chase a particular feature first for the first day.. and I would spend weeks completing a simple project.. which is inefficient and total waste when I think about it now. Then the more important part&amp;hellip; The db design.. I have worked with db with languages like c#, python and PHP..&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//bluepie.live/blog/2018/07/php-contd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As i mentioned in the previous post.. i choose php and ignored rest of them because i wanted to do a project in php for a long time and i choose to use this as an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through the thought process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i needed to do a application basically (webapp) with user login, registration, with admin privilages, then with adding item, updating the item,  deleting the item, assigning the item, reassign the item etc.. SO with php i have to dynamically generate stuff based on the content and available resources.. with login registration ,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title> corrupt card..contd		</title>
      <link>//bluepie.live/blog/2018/06/corrupt-card-contd/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well how you&amp;rsquo;ll doin.. im gona continue the post that i left some days earlier.. Mind you i might have forgotten.. ill post the updates in the comments as updates..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i was talking about looking into docs of packages, &lt;em&gt;you need to know that the format of the card was &amp;lsquo;exfat&amp;rsquo; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;check about exfat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was looking into exfat related packages. Experimented with some of the packages and i was going nowhere regarding the card-solving&amp;hellip; then suddenly i landed in github issue tracker..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;looks like people where historical and complaining&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;i need to remind this again, others peoples card failed on them but mine was a differnent scenario.. check my previous post.. i&amp;rsquo;ve explained it cleaner there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i didn&amp;rsquo;t make notes while for writing later in this blog of mine.. forgive me for that.. i&amp;rsquo;ll try doing that from next time..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title> Data Loss - Corrupt card		</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hye there.. well lets begin as you can guess from the title.. I can assure you that it was completely my fault.. About the sd card its the one that you see in the image, so lets get into more detail shall we..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;why-you-may-ask&#34;&gt;why?.. you may ask&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was experimenting with some stuff relating to sim card tray.. that involved removing and inserting the micro sd card rapidly. &lt;em&gt;i never believed in safely un-mounting the sd card.. BOY did i learn a lesson here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;repeated tampering with the card made the card fail.. #rip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;cause&#34;&gt;Cause&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the card had a safety feature..which is if the card detects phase of data loss it goes into read mode and remains in that state forever. &lt;em&gt;apparently the card i had was produced mainly for photography and stuff.. the kid that i was..when i bought the card..i didn&amp;rsquo;t know all these stuffs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
