On the windows part  i was mostly doing with debuggers, scripts and memory. So here i am explaining the tale of how i started my venture into c# and security, back in the days i used to do admire crack realeases, trainers,  etc. So at the begining when i was in 10th grade i already knew that i was going in the path of a software and choose computer science in the next year (senior year).</p><p>I began to learn form core about debugging. processors, assembly, etc, At the same time that i was doing that i began to have an interest in trainers and what not, but the main problem was i knew how to find memeoy addresses by debugging and scanning through different tools but i did not know how to do them programmatically. so the venture started in c#, since there was already a ton of source available in visual basic and i knew c and object oriented programming and c# is similar to java in many ways and the fact that i was mostly working  in windows made me lean over c#.</p><p>At the begining it was tough i didn&rsquo;t know where to start, but little by little i learned at that time and was doing projects by using a custom library for my projects involving meomory stuff, so when i was in home recently and going through my old desktop i found the lib and soo i took it seperately dusted it off worked on that for cleaning it made sure it worked on the latest build, built a seperate dill, compiled and released it on github, Looking at that project after a long time, made me release why i even choose this field, at those days everything was fascinating to me and i wanted to learn everything, So for any new beginners entering into reversing, modding, creating trainers and c# I have created this repo for them. Most stuff on usage, reason and lib  are on the github repo given below.</p><h3 id=source-code-link-link-to-my-repo-https-github-com-aghontpi-memorypatternscanner>Source Code link <a href=https://github.com/aghontpi/MemoryPatternScanner rel="nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>link to my repo.</a></h3></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>
