The thing about old projects is that they have an emotional touch with them, the reason why i am stating this is because, i think about the functionalities and often about how this could be implemented with the current knowledge that i have, being the way that I am, I mix real life with the code that i write, often times while i write the documentation, review the code that I wrote, or while making commit <em>i find hints in my code that reflected the current scenario in my life.</em> Its like when i see the code again, I&rsquo;m taken back to the room that i wrote the code in, the thought i had, the emotional state i was in, the people i was talking too.. etc.. FOR EXAMPLE, today I recalled a old friend of mine, (lets begin) it was 2017, i was in my final year of my B.E degree, a festival function was near and i was practising android and developing an android application, during that time i was constantly talking to my friend that i mentioned, During this period i was home alone for few days, I can not recall more than this..(my dumb brain). Fast forward to 3-4 am in the night, i remember completing a class with functionalities (doing java), I noticed while creating an instance of the class i made the class name similar to my friends nick name. <em><strong>i could still remember that specific moment very clearly. </strong>I took an image of that specific section and sent a message.. the following morning she didn&rsquo;t understand what i was saying..that&rsquo;s a completely different story none the less.</em></p><h3 id=so-one-of-the-reasons-to-not-going-to-old-projects>so one of the reasons to not going to old projects</h3><p>Going back to old projects they have a emotional weight in them, <strong>sometimes it&rsquo;s the decision of not wanting to go the past, that certain people don&rsquo;t go to old projects.</strong> The fact that certain things turned out ugly, i could never revisit some projects, if i still do, I spiral into a hole and my thoughts get cloudy and i feel guilty for the things why certain things turned out ugly.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>So in my case, i realised, humans are emotional beings, being the way that they are, often leads to problems..</em></strong></p></blockquote></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>
