<p>Well how you&rsquo;ll doin.. im gona continue the post that i left some days earlier.. Mind you i might have forgotten.. ill post the updates in the comments as updates..</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>So i was talking about looking into docs of packages, <em>you need to know that the format of the card was &lsquo;exfat&rsquo;</em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">check about exfat</a>.</p>

<p>i was looking into exfat related packages. Experimented with some of the packages and i was going nowhere regarding the card-solving&hellip; then suddenly i landed in github issue tracker..</p>

<p>looks like people where historical and complaining&hellip; <strong>i need to remind this again, others peoples card failed on them but mine was a differnent scenario.. check my previous post.. i&rsquo;ve explained it cleaner there.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t make notes while for writing later in this blog of mine.. forgive me for that.. i&rsquo;ll try doing that from next time..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so i was going throught this tons of posts and feedbacks on the repo&rsquo;s issue tracker.. so i learned from the comments that the maintainer of the repo has a branch that would soleve this issue.. so i checked out the branch and configured it, compiled it and make sure it works.. then the testing stuff comes.</p>

<p>I encountered some problems with this..<em>i&rsquo;ll spare you the details basically bought some new card readers and one of them fixed the problem</em>,, so thats the end of that.. so coming to the card issue.. some issure were fixible by the branch but i landed on the same problem in the last, which is the io error..</p>

<p>At this point in my search to rescure my sd card.. i know on thing for sure and that is my bootloader/boot partition of the sd card was dead..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so the next phase after trying several packages comes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After i figured out that boot was the problem i tried to go in that way.. which is writing to some first byte to the sd card basically nulling the bytes&hellip;</p>

<p><strong><em>You should never do this  unless you know what this does to your card..</em></strong></p>

<p>so it was working without io errors but the card still wont let me to format the card..gave io error in that portion  of the process..</p>

<p> am keeping this short..i was going no where just trying the samething over with slight modifications and slight changes.. so thats that..</p>

<p>this briefly cover the linux side of things atleast what i felt was important and that came to y mind while i was typing this..</p>

<hr />

<p>In windows i tried only several applications that where readily available.. belive me there were ton and tried them tall.. i also tried the command line stuff that where available in windows.</p>

<p>I tried from sevreal recovery software that gave options to fix caards,, several dumb blogs, legacy software..etc</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this point you must know that i was desperate and working for like god knows how many hours i have spent trying to give life to the card..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the last thing that i done was trying custom builds of applications..</p>

<p><strong>So i decided to let the sd card go.. i put the sd card in a safe place and never looked it again.. there might be some way but that was enough for me at that point&hellip; i didnt sleep.. i didn&rsquo;t eat.. i was tunnel visioning that thing.. so thats the end of that.</strong> <strong><em>I intende to finish this section by this post so left out most of the stuff out.. i can fix it if if try harder spen dsome more days/weeks.. but i choose not to.. have decided to move on.. =).</em></strong></p>
