<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>***I know i&rsquo;ve been busy, but i can make up to it. Status update First: The last few weeks,infact the last month is very odd and had a busy schedule. I could&rsquo;nt concentrate on few other projects, Office work took over my life, to be exact!.I&rsquo;ve been the preacher of saying Complete office work early as possible and leave office by 8pm, later spend time for yourself(doing your own thing) like for an example updating blog. To think that i used to say those things but in reality i ended up like this!..</p>

<p>makes me wana just laugh. The first thing i realised is that i dont have not that much time for thinking.. like a zombie wandering around, life is just moving in an unknown path, Going back to my mates and spending the valuable time is priceless and makes me focus on things better, Maybe currently im not surrended by people like that in places I work and live. well that&rsquo;s for update.***</p>

<h2 id="the-thing-i-did">The thing i did</h2>

<p>So what is touch typing? typing without seeing the keyboards, using the f&amp;j as references because they have bumps on them, you feel them as a reference, You can recognise this by the word  &ldquo;Type-Writer&rdquo;,  back in the days they used ti have type writing class everywhere,  even now there are classes but are fewer and fewer nowadays.  Anywhere there are fewer and fewer people trying to type in this way because they have developed their own way of typing. I have taken this task some time before, i would think like i&rsquo;d learn part of the system and remaining part in upcoming days,  but after this section, i would never go back, maybe i forget that i have to do that or i&rsquo;ll get something else that I have to do and totally forget about all about it.eventually when i was involved in more and more typing I developed my own typing style which is not perfect but helped me to type faster upto 40 words per minute, which is somewhat good, but i would type with only some of my fingers, which in turn hurts and became tired after somebit. This was not enough and finally i decided I&rsquo;d give it a try, i know i might go along with this for a few days but eventually will give up on this, so as far as i&rsquo;m concerned i have to complete this quick, like real quick, So i decided to complete all the course on a single go(with atleast 90% accuracy). So it started, i&rsquo;ve worked for 8 hours straight &amp; completed everything, i knew how to type now but the problem is practicing, to make it faster and better. The other problem is my old typing habbits began to affect me, the new typing style was slow, thus while typing in my work it started to affect, thus had to go back to old style for completing my work faster, from then on its been a constant struggle between switching between different styles, Everyone should learn this, its super comfy. Besides it&rsquo;s the official way to type, It&rsquo;ll be massively helpful if done at a young age, Trust me on this one, Anyhooo0oo I typed this whole post with the new style of typing. One could say that is the reason why it took this long for the post, lol. See you next time!.</p>
