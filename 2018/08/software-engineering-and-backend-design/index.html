Then the more important part&hellip; The db design.. I have worked with db with languages like c#, python and PHP..</p></blockquote><p>the main aspect of this is that I would straight up go to table design without thinking about normalization, optimisation, memory limits, accessibility and query execution. This was back in my pre college, inbetween college starting and after 12th final exams. Then the times shifted.. still I didn&rsquo;t know about normalization, etc&hellip; But I was doing things differently well I would plan and do things now.. but still this was not enough, later I would realise.. I still was thinking why does it take soo long and sooo many iterations to complete a simple project..the teen that I was in my early days. Then came the university studies and learner about some stuff.. I came across a lot of different stuff that helped me. The period ranges from my mid college days and final ranges.. the third section of my current life. I was doing this lot differently than from the first days of my young developing career. But still I was not doing a lot than I was now.. which is would design db but that consisted of only normal stuff like &lsquo; do I have all the things necessary for doing the project?&rsquo;, &lsquo;does this contain all the details?&rsquo; and &lsquo;is this optimised for retrieving data?&rsquo; etc&hellip; but still no normalization..after I knew about this. For the past somedays ihave been introduced to software engineering and the core concepts and I have been told to structurally implement this, so I this also covers db design with wireframe,data elements, different types of normalization and other tons of stuff that I have to do.. this is teadious but I&rsquo;m realising that from my previous experiments that a lost of post development problems are being solved right now.</p><blockquote><p>SO THIS PART IS VERY PRECIOUS TO A DEVELOPER.</p></blockquote><p>And from here on out, I took a vow to follow the same on future projects so that I wouldnt be a mess and will solve most problems from the first to deal with and I hope I won&rsquo;t forget these things in the future..</p><p><strong><em><em>NOTE TO SELF : YOU USED TWO NOTES DURING THE WHOLE PROCESS WIHTOUT ANY COMPUTER/DIGITAL STUFF&hellip; SO KEEP THEM SAFE AND FOLLOW IT EVERYTIME.</em></em></strong></p><h3 id=thoughts>Thoughts:</h3><p>So i thought this would be a important lesson in my developing career so I am logging this as a post so that I would not forget about this.
