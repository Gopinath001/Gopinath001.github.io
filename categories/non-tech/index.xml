&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reality-is-way-different-update-on-current-things&#34;&gt;Reality is way different - Update on current things.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;***I know i&amp;rsquo;ve been busy, but i can make up to it. Status update First: The last few weeks,infact the last month is very odd and had a busy schedule. I could&amp;rsquo;nt concentrate on few other projects, Office work took over my life, to be exact!.I&amp;rsquo;ve been the preacher of saying Complete office work early as possible and leave office by 8pm, later spend time for yourself(doing your own thing) like for an example updating blog. To think that i used to say those things but in reality i ended up like this!..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h4 id=&#34;identifying-problem&#34;&gt;Identifying problem:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was that..the phone would not boot up or anything.. wont even go to the recovery mode.. but there is a catch when it is plugged into a charger outlet only the led link will blink..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well how you&amp;rsquo;ll doin.. im gona continue the post that i left some days earlier.. Mind you i might have forgotten.. ill post the updates in the comments as updates..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i was talking about looking into docs of packages, &lt;em&gt;you need to know that the format of the card was &amp;lsquo;exfat&amp;rsquo; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow noreferrer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;check about exfat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was looking into exfat related packages. Experimented with some of the packages and i was going nowhere regarding the card-solving&amp;hellip; then suddenly i landed in github issue tracker..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;looks like people where historical and complaining&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;i need to remind this again, others peoples card failed on them but mine was a differnent scenario.. check my previous post.. i&amp;rsquo;ve explained it cleaner there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i didn&amp;rsquo;t make notes while for writing later in this blog of mine.. forgive me for that.. i&amp;rsquo;ll try doing that from next time..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title> Data Loss - Corrupt card		</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hye there.. well lets begin as you can guess from the title.. I can assure you that it was completely my fault.. About the sd card its the one that you see in the image, so lets get into more detail shall we..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;why-you-may-ask&#34;&gt;why?.. you may ask&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was experimenting with some stuff relating to sim card tray.. that involved removing and inserting the micro sd card rapidly. &lt;em&gt;i never believed in safely un-mounting the sd card.. BOY did i learn a lesson here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;repeated tampering with the card made the card fail.. #rip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;cause&#34;&gt;Cause&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the card had a safety feature..which is if the card detects phase of data loss it goes into read mode and remains in that state forever. &lt;em&gt;apparently the card i had was produced mainly for photography and stuff.. the kid that i was..when i bought the card..i didn&amp;rsquo;t know all these stuffs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
