      <description>Hello, it&amp;rsquo;s been two months since last update. Anyway the August month I was pretty busy, to be honest, I was involved in a old project of mine that I had to revist, in order to get more productive and flexibility in developing the application I chose to use docker. So this post is going to be about docker.
 Status Update:The month of August also had something interesting in it, which is my birthday.</description>
