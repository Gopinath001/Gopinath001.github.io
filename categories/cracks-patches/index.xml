Over the past months, I’ve been using my rooted phone to bypass storage limits and enjoy unlimited Google Photos storage. However, using a rooted device isn’t without its challenges—if someone gains physical access to my phone, my data becomes vulnerable. Banking appsa and even general purpose applications refuse to run on rooted devices because they detect system tampering. In some cases, the Play Store won’t allow you to install certain apps at all.</description></item><item><title>Rooting My Pixel For Unlimited gphotos backup</title><link>//bluepie.in/2024/04/rooting-my-pixel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 03:14:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2024/04/rooting-my-pixel/</guid><description>All the previous android phones I had, I rooted them and used them with a custom ROM that had gphotos mod or used it with gphotos mod, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a pixel for android development as my second device..but all this time, it had stock android and not rooted with no modifications.
But what do I mean by gphotos mod..? You get unlimited photos and videos backup in Google photos, the mod makes it seem like you&amp;rsquo;re using a pixel device.</description></item><item><title>Modding a macOS App</title><link>//bluepie.in/2022/02/modding-a-macos-app/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Feb 2022 19:10:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2022/02/modding-a-macos-app/</guid><description>Intro This post is about reversing.. but for a MACOS binary. Lets drive straight into it.
Modding in macOS is fairly new to me, but a binary is a binary and it can be modded!. I started to daily drive macOS a month or two ago, the why and what&amp;rsquo;s is a whole different story to post about.
Like I have said previously in my other re posts, &amp;ldquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t trust mods from the internet&amp;rdquo; If I can mod it then its fine, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;m paying for it.</description></item><item><title>Android Reversing Part 5 But With Frida</title><link>//bluepie.in/2021/08/android-reversing-part-5-with-frida/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 07:25:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2021/08/android-reversing-part-5-with-frida/</guid><description>Why Frida? Becase it can be many things, know more. Its is,
easy, sure learning curve takes some time, but it pays off spectacularly. efficient, a rough estimate for the modification took 30 min in frida vs 2 hours in traditional methods, its way more flexible. elegant when compared to traditional ways. you get creative new ideas and implement them easily (implementating manually takes way longer). My setup Genymotion, but why?</description></item><item><title>Android Reversing Part 5</title><link>//bluepie.in/2021/07/android-reversing-part-5/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 15:00:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2021/07/android-reversing-part-5/</guid><description>Contents Why &amp;amp; Motivation Decompiling Finding where to patch Patching, recompiling and installing it on device App&amp;rsquo;s premium features does not work fully Finding integrity checks, digging deeper for final patch. End Why &amp;amp; Motivation I wanted to monitor my mobile network traffic after I found some wierd dns logs in my custom dns server, I could not figure out which app made that request thus I found out this app in playstore called &amp;lsquo;No Root Firewall, Internet Data Blocker Protection&amp;rsquo;.</description></item><item><title>Android Reversing Part 3</title><link>//bluepie.in/2020/05/android-reversing-part-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 04:55:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2020/05/android-reversing-part-3/</guid><description>Hi!, Its nice to post weekely for a change, I never posted weekely before, anyway this might be a one time thing(posting weekely).
Disclaimer : Im just sharing information &amp;amp; not distrubuting mod files here! this is strictly for learning purposes only.

Status Update:So, this month I have lost a companion that was with me for the past 4 years, he is not entirely dead but let&amp;rsquo;s say is not the same person he once was&amp;hellip;.wait wait wait! I am talking about my laptop. I was doing an all-nighter &amp;amp; I think it was about 4 a.m. or so I was planning to go to sleep, so so while I was cleaning up &amp;amp; I dropped the laptop from my waist height, I was one of the tallest persons in my class so that explains a lot.</description></item><item><title>C# - A peek into my yunger self.</title><link>//bluepie.in/2019/03/a-peek-into-my-yunger-self/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Mar 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2019/03/a-peek-into-my-yunger-self/</guid><description>Hey guys how y&amp;rsquo;all been,

Well I was working on a project, at one point of time I was working on wireframes, since I was only doing the initial design and it would be just used as a reference by the design team so my senior adviced me to use mockup.
Mockup So what is mockup you ask?</description></item><item><title> Contd..of Initial release of idm patcher</title><link>//bluepie.in/2018/06/contd-of-initial-release-of-idm-patcher/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2018 14:10:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2018/06/contd-of-initial-release-of-idm-patcher/</guid><description>Hi, well yesterday i didnt post due to unforseen circumstances, thats that.. i would like to continue the previous post.. well lets get into it.
