What is this? Creating a preconfigured container for a precompiled binary utilizing docker.
Reason / Motivation: I&amp;rsquo;ve been using hugo, even since my blog migration post, the one problem that I am facing with hugo is that,
whenever I run update os host system,hugo version also updates, the problem with that is some features are deprecated in the new release, my site design depends upon those features.</description></item><item><title>Rinku</title><link>//bluepie.in/2020/07/rinku/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2020 19:22:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2020/07/rinku/</guid><description>Hi! hope you are doing well future me!,
I&amp;rsquo;m well in the comfort of my home, the pandemic isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet, the cases are increasing day by day, infact today, as I am wiriting this, newly infected patients is over 6.5k. The past few weeks has been productive, I&amp;rsquo;m loving what I am doing, learning new stuff, doing a little of reversing at times, Oh snap, I forgot, my harddisk died on me, it was not fun(thank god important stuff were already on a server backed up), had to replace that with an ssd.</description></item></channel></rss>
