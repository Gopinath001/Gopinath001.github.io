Gosh, Its been 6 months already..since I decided to change my username. Incase my future self is wondering, its still work from home, probablly will go chennai after new years&amp;rsquo; i.e 2021.
This month was boring as hell in terms of office work, since I had to work on Extjs, I introduced some flare into it, but making it similar to react, because of this, it much easier to work on.</description></item></channel></rss>
