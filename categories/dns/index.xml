However, when it comes to wildcard domains (like *.domain.com), there’s a bit more work involved—particularly if I want to automate renewals.

Just wanted to try an alternative, after using it for a while, the UI &amp;amp; Features on AGH is much better than pi-hole.
Why a custom dns server? All websites/apis are just ip addresses (just numbers). Nameservers maintains a mapping of the domain names to the ip addresses, so when we make a request, we get the appropriate ip address.</description></item><item><title>Custom Dns Server With Adblock</title><link>//bluepie.in/2019/12/custom-dns-server-with-adblock/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 14:15:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.in/2019/12/custom-dns-server-with-adblock/</guid><description>hello guys, as of writing this post this is christmas of 2019 (25 dec 2019), gosh time really goes fast!.
