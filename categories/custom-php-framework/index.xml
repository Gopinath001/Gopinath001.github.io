I&amp;rsquo;m well in the comfort of my home, the pandemic isn&amp;rsquo;t over yet, the cases are increasing day by day, infact today, as I am wiriting this, newly infected patients is over 6.5k. The past few weeks has been productive, I&amp;rsquo;m loving what I am doing, learning new stuff, doing a little of reversing at times, Oh snap, I forgot, my harddisk died on me, it was not fun(thank god important stuff were already on a server backed up), had to replace that with an ssd.</description></item></channel></rss>
