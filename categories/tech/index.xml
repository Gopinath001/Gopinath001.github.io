Continuation. Pick up where i left off from previous post: Let me explain the way of approach i wanted to do, i wanted to access all the files of the server, like i wanted to go back to the root directory, back before that, basically anywhere where i wanted, So DirectoryIterator seemed the best choice, We are in a directory, we have to list all the files and folders in the directory, how would you do that?</description></item><item><title> file manager development</title><link>//bluepie.live/blog/2018/10/file-manager-development/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 19:21:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>//bluepie.live/blog/2018/10/file-manager-development/</guid><description>why this all of a sudden? I was introduced to php development for a little while now, and i had this in mind with several other things, this would also be a good point to start explaining with code, So where to start. let us define?

Well I was working on a project, at one point of time I was working on wireframes, since I was only doing the initial design and it would be just used as a reference by the design team so my senior adviced me to use mockup.
