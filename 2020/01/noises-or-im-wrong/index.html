This post is not going to be about tech.. so skip this if you wish. note: this post was completed in the month of januray but only published it on feb.</em></em></strong></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><h2 id=what-is-this-about>what is this about</h2></blockquote><p>So lately i&rsquo;ve been contemplating on a lot of things!, some of &lsquo;em include, life goals, relationships, fiends, money, how we interact as human beings, etc&hellip;all these are interconnected to one another, I have decided to share this today as im 23 years old, it would be fun to see how things change over the years when im 28, 33, .. so forth.</p><blockquote><h3 id=life-goals>life goals</h3></blockquote><p>Can I ask you something? what is your life goal, It should be either of two, <em>1. you have a defined life goal, 2. you do not have a life goal, you are going with a flow</em>, I have experienced both of &lsquo;em, so here is my take on it.</p><p>You are moving towards a point and all actions that you make must be towards that point you belong to this category if you have a life goal, in-short: Short term goals that matter in the long run(to achieve a final goal).</p><p>You take decisions based on what you currently feel/have, short term goals that doesn&rsquo;t matter in the long run.</p><p>There is a third category that I did not mention, which is terrible of em all, which is you take decisions based on other people&rsquo;s suggestion, it is bad beacuse u feel regrets after the decision is made and you realise that, you are responsible for your
current scenario by not taking your own decision.(confusing i know, but there it is)</p><p>my parents are both 2nd category from my point of view, atleast my father is.. I strieve to be the first category&hellip; but I am weak.</p><blockquote><h3 id=relationships>relationships</h3><p>This was my openion when i was in my 10th grade, 11th &amp; 12th, love is a beautiful thing, is a necessity, is a social status, you are a if you are not currently in a loving relationship.</p></blockquote><p>This was an anwser of mine before 3 years ago, when i was asked a question &ldquo;what do you think about love?&rdquo; in a group gathering of my peers, teachers &amp; parents, &lsquo;is just a distraction, a mixture of chemical compounds in brain is to be blamed for it.&rsquo; So my openion is little changed, i&rsquo;ve removed &ldquo;its just a distraction part&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><h3 id=friendships>friendships</h3></blockquote><p>when i was young(upuntill 12th) I had a lot of friends, it was a social status, I dont care about it anymore(was not selfaware at that time, more about this maybe in a different post),</p><blockquote><h3 id=core-belief-s>core-belief&rsquo;s</h3></blockquote><p>This thing dawned on me few months ago &amp; once in a while i&rsquo;ve been thinking about it ever since, what am i talking about here?,</p><p>Well it is about &ldquo;everyone has their own belief such as what makes one&rsquo;s action differ from right and
wrong, what is considered humiliation, what is considered success, sadness, depression&hellip;etc.&rdquo; these belief&rsquo;s come from either through
parents or from movies/shows(mostly), talking with others(mostly), (rarely) from books, and very rare from own experience. since we
do not in-herit these belief&rsquo;s from own experience/thoughts, it will not be useful for you &amp; if you make decisions its gona 70% of the time
fail for you(if you belong to the minority category of different people).</p><p>So my conclusion from all this is &ldquo;unless you are absolutely sure about your core belief, do not think over it of the outcomes&rdquo;,</p><blockquote><h3 id=my-utopian-dream>my utopian dream</h3></blockquote><p>So from my childhood i have seen my surroundings &amp; i dreamt I would go in a different path, Which is &ldquo;People become thick friends, go out, , fall in love, get married to people in the circle only they interact with/ their neighbours.&rdquo; &amp; I wanted this to be opposite of that, but right untill now i&rsquo;ve had chances to claim my dream but I did not do so, (mmo&rsquo;s, guild&rsquo;s, discord, tele, communi..onli..).</p><hr><p><strong><em>anyway these are my present thoughts, see ya soon!. hope u do well untill then -gopinath.</em></strong></p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>
