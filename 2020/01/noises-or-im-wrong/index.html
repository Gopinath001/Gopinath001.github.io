current scenario by not taking your own decision.(confusing i know, but there it is)</p><p>my parents are both 2nd category from my point of view, atleast my father is.. I strieve to be the first category&hellip; but I am weak.</p><blockquote><h3 id=relationships>relationships</h3><p>This was my openion when i was in my 10th grade, 11th &amp; 12th, love is a beautiful thing, is a necessity, is a social status, you are a if you are not currently in a loving relationship.</p></blockquote><p>This was an anwser of mine before 3 years ago, when i was asked a question &ldquo;what do you think about love?&rdquo; in a group gathering of my peers, teachers &amp; parents, &lsquo;is just a distraction, a mixture of chemical compounds in brain is to be blamed for it.&rsquo; So my openion is little changed, i&rsquo;ve removed &ldquo;its just a distraction part&rdquo;.</p><blockquote><h3 id=friendships>friendships</h3></blockquote><p>when i was young(upuntill 12th) I had a lot of friends, it was a social status, I dont care about it anymore(was not selfaware at that time, more about this maybe in a different post), there is only two openions that I have right now,
1. From my pov - who are friends -&gt; I have a mindless time when I am with them, so I take all the steps/necessities while I am being with them, money, buying things, me driving to their place,&hellip;etc
2. They dont share the first openion as i do, but they need me for some purpose or they just use me when they are bored. its sad that i have these thoughts (self-aware) but its the truth.</p><blockquote><h3 id=my-utopian-dream>my utopian dream</h3></blockquote><p>So from my childhood i have seen my surroundings &amp; i dreamt I would go in a different path, Which is &ldquo;People become thick friends, go out, , fall in love, get married to people in the circle only they interact with/ their neighbours.&rdquo; &amp; I wanted this to be opposite of that, but right untill now i&rsquo;ve had chances to claim my dream but I did not do so, (mmo&rsquo;s, guild&rsquo;s, discord, telegram).</p><hr><p><strong><em>anyway these are my present thoughts, see ya soon!. hope u do well untill then -gopinath.</em></strong></p></div><div class=post-copyright><p class=copyright-item><span>Author:</span>
